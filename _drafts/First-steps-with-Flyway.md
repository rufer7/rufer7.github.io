After reading a blog post about the database migration tool [Flyway](http://flywaydb.org) on [jaxenter](http://jaxenter.de) I decided to play around with it in the context of a little sample project. The sample project is implemented in java and shows the usage of the flyway maven plugin in combination with a h2 database.


#### About Flyway

A short introduction about database migrations can be found [here](http://flywaydb.org/getstarted/why.html). To get some basic information about Flyway and how it works have a look at [How Flyway works @Flywaydb.org](http://flywaydb.org/getstarted/how.html).
