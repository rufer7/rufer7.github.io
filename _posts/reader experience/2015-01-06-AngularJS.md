For getting deeper knowledge concerning AngularJS I decided to read the book "AngularJS", which was written by Brad Green and Shyam Seshadri and published by O'Reilly. To understand the content you should be familiar with at least HTML and Javascript.

The book starts with a nice introduction, which gives the reader a short overview about the most important concepts. In the following chapters the authors go more into detail.

First the most important directives and components, functions and filters are presented and explained. Furthermore the possibilities for modularization and separation of responsibilities like modules, controllers and services are adressed.

Another chapter, one of the bigger ones, treats all topics around setup and organization of an AngularJS project. It covers the presentation of recommended tools, plugins and best practices regarding unit testing, End-to-end/integration testing and debugging

In the biggest chapter of the book the authors dive into a sample application, analyze all parts of it and show as well some best practices.

The next part of the book is about client-server-communication, where different ways of dealing with restful resources are explained. The subsequent chapter focus on directives, one of the most interesting topics concerning AngularJS in my opinion. In the end of the book the reader finds some practical examples like socket.io and login with AngularJS.

Due to the frequent releases of new Angular versions some parts of the book are already a bit outdated. Although I learned a lot about AngularJS while reading the book. Especially I got interesting background information regarding the concepts and thoughts behind Angular. I like the way the authors care about testing. The examples always contain some testing examples too. In conclusion I would recommend this book to everybody, who wants to get in touch with AngularJS.
