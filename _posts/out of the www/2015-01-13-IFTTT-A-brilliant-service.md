IFTTT.com, a brilliant service for everybody for triggering actions based on channels. While searching for a possibility to automatically post and tweet new items of an RSS-Feed a friend has recommended me IFTTT.


[IFTTT](https://ifttt.com) means "If this, then that" and describes quite good what it does. The base of [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com) are channels like [facebook](http://www.facebook.com), [twitter](http://www.twitter.com), [gmail](http://www.gmail.com) and a lot more. The idea of the "if this"-part is, that you can trigger events like new posts on facebook, new items in rss-feeds and so on. Such a trigger will then kick off an action, which builds the "then that"-part.
For my case it worked perfectly. I created a recipe, that's how [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com) calls the combination of a trigger and an action from channels. My recipe triggers new items of the RSS-Feed of my blog and creates a new tweet on my twitter profile.
A friend recommended this service to me (Thanks to José Álvarez) and I recommend it to you. The website is build very intuitive, easy to use and provides a lot of possibilities. Try it out!
