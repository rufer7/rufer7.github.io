    <h1>About me</h1>

    <p>I was born and grown up in Moosseedorf a village in the agglomeration of Bern. After primary school and a subsequent apprenticeship in electronics I studied computer science at the Bern University of Applied Science.</p>
    <p>Since my studies I'm working as a Software Engineer. From August 2013 until May 2015 I worked at <a href="http://www.mimacom.com/" style="font-weight:bold">mimacom ag</a> in Bern and since June 2015 I'm working at <a href="http://www.d-fens.ch/" style="font-weight:bold">d-fens GmbH</a>. I like working with open source technologies and frameworks like <a href="http://www.spring.io/" style="font-weight:bold">Spring</a>, <a href="http://www.angularjs.org/" style="font-weight:bold">AngularJS</a>, <a href="http://www.docker.com/" style="font-weight:bold">Docker</a>,... and so on. My main strengths are the development of web applications and RESTful-Backend-Services.</p>
    <p>Besides my job I like to experiment with new technologies and using them for my own little projects. Furthermore I'm a passionate floorball player. I'm playing for the <a href="http://www.hornets.ch/" style="font-weight:bold">Hornets Regio Moosseedorf Worblental</a>, where I'm a participant of the committee</p>
